# Movie Application

A Multipage Web Application showcasing all the movies that are either released or has yet to be released. The features of the application includes a search bar for searching movies based on title or keywords, a separate page for viewing specific movie details and casts as well as a movie player for the trailer. The application was built using ReactJS and Typescript. All movies are fetched using the TMDB API and Tailwind was used to create the styles for the application.
